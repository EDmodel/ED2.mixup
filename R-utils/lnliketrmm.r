   #     EXTREMELY CONTROVERSIAL POINT.  I DON'T THINK THIS IS REALLY RIGHT, BUT THAT WAS  #
   # THE BEST I COULD THINK...                                                             #
   #   There is nothing that prevents PP to be zero or one.  However, when PP is 0, the    #
   # support would be 0 if p is also 0, and -Infinity otherwise.  Likewise, when PP is 1,  #
   # support would be 0 if p is also 1, and -Infinity otherwise.  This is bad... My        #
   # argument is that if PP is 0, it doesn't necessarily mean that PP is really 0, because #
   # this was computed based on discrete data, and therefore it could be anything between  #
   # 0 and 0.5/NN.  Therefore I just make it 0.25/NN, and assume that the mean and         #
   # standard deviation are the average value for the entire domain.  Likewise, if PP is   #
   # 1, I assume that the PP is actually (NN-0.25)/NN, but keep the same distribution that #
   # was found.  The advantage of doing this is that it penalises the model by a lot if    #
   # NN is large and by a little when NN is small.                                         #
